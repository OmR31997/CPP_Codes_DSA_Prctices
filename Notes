/** Introduction **/
C++ was developed by "Bjarne Stroustrup" in 1985 is extesion of C language.

/** Variable **/
Variable are used to store data.
A variable in C++ is a named memory location (or container) that can store a value which can change during program execution.
    - If the value can change, it's a regular variable.
    - If the value must not change, we use the const keyword, making it a constant.

/** Data Type **/
A data type in C++ determines the kind of value a variable can store, such as integers, characters, floating-point numbers, etc.
    - How much memory to allocate
    - What kind of operations are allowed
    - What kind of values the variable can hold
    1. int 4 Byte
    2. float 4 Byte
    3. double 8 Byte  
    4. char 1 Byte
    5. string if 'Krishna' then 32 Byte
    6. bool 1 Byte
    
Note: When work with char[] extra 1 byte used for the null terminator (\0).
Note: "Krishna" has 7 letters, but string object may take 24, 32, or more bytes.

/** Type Casting **/
Type Casting means converting a variable from one data type to another.
Two Types in C++: (→ Implication Symbol & ⇔ Birectional Symbol)
1. Type Coercion/Conversion/Implicit (Automatic) is usually used to Low Data Type → High Data Type
2. Type Casting/Explicit (Manual) is usually used to Low Data Type ← High Data Type  

/** Input/Output Object **/
cout << is used to display output on the screen.
cin >> is used to take input from the user through the keyboard.

/** Operators **/
An operator is a symbol/keyword that performs a specific operation on one or more operands (values or variables).
1. Arithmatic : To perform some mathematical operation.
2. Relational : To find the relation between two situation and return something in the form of "true" or "false". 
3. Logical : Perform beteen between two relation the give return something in the form of "true" or "false".
4. Unary : Unary operator always has single or one operands.

/** Conditional Statement**/
A "Condtional Statement" is a way to make decisions in a program - it allows the program to choose different action based on whether a condition is "true" or "false".
1. if, if-else, if-else if-else
